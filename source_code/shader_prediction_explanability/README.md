## Scripts Explanation

All the scripts are written in python 3.8. To run the script, please lunch a python tools like Anaconda or directly run "python xx.py" 

A Frame's Scene Prediction

   [Prepare dataset (Merge all graphs)](merge_allGraphs_PerFrame.py)

   An example to merge all graphs in the same frame as one disjoint graph. 
   
   [GCN with interpretability library](https://github.com/tsKenneth/interpretable-graph-classification)

   Make use of the existing libraries for GCN and the result explainability.
